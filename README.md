# Analysis of Complex Networks

## Homework 3

**Name**: Othmane Mahfoud
**Group**: Number 9

### Instructions

1. Please make sure you download the Group 9 data
2. Please make sure you change the "file_path" variable in the code according to your own file location
3. Please do not run the first cell if you are not on Google Colab
4. Please run all the cells in homework_3.ipynb in order
5. In case the .ipynb file is corrupted you can find an updated version in the repository https://github.com/othmane-mahfoud/hw_3_complex_networks/tree/main

### Assumptions

1. For question (b) since no named model is mentioned in particular I opted for using ```powerlaw_cluster_graph``` for generating a scale-free network
2. For the last question I assume the type of comparison requested is purely visual based on the plots made initially
